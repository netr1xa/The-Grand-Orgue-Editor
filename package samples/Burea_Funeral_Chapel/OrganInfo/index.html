  <h1>Bureå funeral chapel organ sampleset</h1>
  <img src="kapellorgel.jpg" alt="A picture of the Bureå funeral chapel organ">
  <p>This organ was built in 1990 by Johannes Menzel Orgelbyggeri AB for the funeral chapel in Bureå, Sweden.</p>
  <p>The recording of the samples was done in December 2009 by Lars Palo with a M-Audio Microtrack II and the enclosed little stereo condenser microphone.
     The recording settings were stereo 16 bit and 44100 Hz samplerate.</p>
  <p>The sampleset is created by Lars Palo with help and lots of advice from the members of <a href="http://www.jeuxdorgues.com">www.jeuxdorgues.com</a> forum.
     (Special thanks to Graham Goode for his kind and untiring advice giving. Without his help this would not have been possible!)
     Noise reduction of the samples was made with <a href="http://www.appletonaudio.com">Nick Appletons Noise Reduce software</a> 
     (there's now a Linux version officially available from Nicks page as well!).</p>
  <p>The original specification of the organ is:</p>
  <table summary="Composition of the Bureå funeral chapel organ">
   <caption>Bureå funeral chapel organ, 1990</caption>
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <th>Manual (56 notes, C-g3)</th>
     <th>Pedal (27 notes, C-d1)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Salicional 8' (B+D)</td>
     <td>Subbas 16'</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Gedakt 8' (B+D)</td>
     <td>Man/P</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Voix Celeste 8' (B+D)</td>
     <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Rörflöjt 4' (B+D)</td>
     <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Principal 2' (B+D)</td>
     <td></td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>Beside the original specification there's an extended version included where Salicional 8' 
     has its own pipes from C (036) to B (047) which were created from the octave above. Also the
     compass of the manual is increased to C-c4 (61 notes) and the pedal is increased to C-g1 (32 notes). 
     A new pedalstop, Gedackt 8', was created from the Subbas 16' pipes to allow the pedal to be used more independantly.
     Two new manual stops, a Quinte 2 2/3 and Third 1 3/5 were created by taking advantage of the re-tuning feature of GrandOrgue.
     To make playing easier 10 general combinations were added as well as buttons for some built-in features like GC,
     Set, Forward & Backward in the free combination (sequencer) list.</p>
