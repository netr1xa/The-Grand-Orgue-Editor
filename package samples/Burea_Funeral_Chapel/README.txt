Information about the organ can be found in the index.html file in the OrganInfo folder.

This sampleset is created for GrandOrgue 0.3.0.5 or later. Even though it should load in
earlier versions you won't be able to take advantage of the enhanced features the 
development version of GrandOrgue offer.

I hope you'll enjoy playing this little organ!
